# Java fundmentals

In this module we're going to look at the fundemental syntax of Java including classes, operators, and conditionals.

To follow along you can clone this repo which containers starter code and the finished version:
https://github.com/Raphael40/Java-Course-Support-Repo

Once cloned you can open the Java-Course-Support-Repo directory in InteliJ and checkout onto the java-fundamentals branch.
