# Get up and running

## Install a JDK

In order to develop apps with Java we need three things;

1. A Java code compiler called the 'Java Virtual Machine'. The JVM is a runtime that hosts Java programs. It works by compiling Java into Java bytecode and then interpreting the bytecode to run it on the underlying hardware platform. This is why Java is so easy to run on Windows, Linux and iOS.
2. A 'Java Runtime Environment' (JRE) which is a package of tools that runs Java programs by creating the JVMs and loading programs into them.
3. A 'Java Development Kit' (JDK) which provides the tools necessary to write/develop the Java programs that can be executed and run by the JRE and JVM. This includes a version of the language Java.

Luckily, since being able to run Java programs is part of development, the JVM and JRE come as part of the JDk so we only need to install a JDK.

In this course we are going to use JDK 17 because it is the most recent version with long term support.
You can download it for MacOS, Linux, and Windows [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17)
If you have a package manager like Homebrew you can use it to easily install a JDK.

Once that is installed we want to install IntelliJ
