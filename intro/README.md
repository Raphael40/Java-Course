# What is Java (And why should you learn it?)

Java is a free programming language and computing platform released by Sun Microsystems and designed by James Gosling in 1995. It is commonly used for programming web applications, game development, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. It is a strongly typed language that is mostly used for object oriented programming and has a wide range of supporting tools and active community. It also has a framework called Spring Boot which makes developing REST APIs significantly easier. We will cover this in more detail in the second half of the course.

Java is a good choice for beginners because not only is it relatively easy to learn compared to C and C++ but it's also extremely popular with a search for Java on job sites such as Indeed or LinkedIn yielding thousands of results. It can also be run easily on Windows, Linux, and iOS.

Before we can use it we first need to set up our device and install the Java Virtual Machine so we can run Java o our devices.
