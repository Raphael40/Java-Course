It is used to build websites, games, artificial intelligence, and more.

It also has many frameworks, including `Spring Boot` which makes development from scratch significantly easier.


### Why learn Java

Java is a good choice for beginners because it is relatively easy to learn compared to similar languages, such as C and C++, and is extremely popular. A search for Java on job sites such as Indeed or LinkedIn yields thousands of results. Java can also be run on Windows, Linux, and iOS.
