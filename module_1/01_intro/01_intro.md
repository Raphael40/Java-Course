### Origins

Java is a free programming language and computing platform released by Sun Microsystems and designed by James Gosling in 1995.

It is used to build websites, games, artificial intelligence, and much more.

It also has many frameworks including `Spring Boot` which makes developing apps from scratch significantly easier.

### Why learn Java

Java is a good choice for beginners because not only is it relatively easy to learn compared to similar languages such as C and C++ but it's also extremely popular. A search for Java on job sites such as Indeed or LinkedIn yields thousands of results. It can also be run easily on Windows, Linux, and iOS.
