# What is Java (And why learn it?)

### Origins

Java is a free programming language and computing platform released by Sun Microsystems and designed by James Gosling in 1995.

It is used to build websites, games, artificial intelligence, and much more.

It also has a framework called `Spring Boot` which makes developing REST APIs (backends) significantly easier. We will use Spring Boot in the second half of the course.

### Why learn Java

Java is a good choice for beginners because not only is it relatively easy to learn compared to similar languages such as C and C++ but it's also extremely popular. A search for Java on job sites such as Indeed or LinkedIn yields thousands of results. It can also be run easily on Windows, Linux, and iOS.

I personally decided to learn it because I am job hunting. I know `JavaScript` fairly well and wanted to learn a good backend langauge to use instead of `Node.js`. I hoped this would make me more employable to a wider range or roles. But who knows!
